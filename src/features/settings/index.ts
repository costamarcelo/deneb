 * Some settings may not inherently change the data view, but should signal
 * that we should re-process it. These are when:
 *
 * - Cross-filtering is enabled/disabled (we need to add/remove the field that
 *      tracks selection state)
 * - Cross-highlighting (we need to swap out highlight values for originals
 *      within the Deneb dataset)
 * - Data limit override (we may have had a segment in the metadata indicating
 *      there were more rows ot load, but we previously opted to ignore it)
